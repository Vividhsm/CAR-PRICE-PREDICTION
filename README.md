# CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION
This project is aimed at predicting the prices of cars based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of a car given its features.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical data on various cars including their features and corresponding prices. It contains information such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and other attributes.

Files

car_price_prediction.py: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
cardetails.csv: This file contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
Setup

To run the notebook and reproduce the results, you need Python 3.x along with the following libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd car-price-prediction
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook car_price_prediction.ipynb
Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
Model
The model used for this prediction task is a Gradient Boosting Regressor, a type of ensemble learning technique. It has been chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships between features and to produce accurate predictions.

Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score. These metrics help to gauge the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model for car price prediction. By leveraging historical data and utilizing advanced algorithms, we can create a tool that provides valuable insights into the pricing of cars based on their attributes.
